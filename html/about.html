      <h1>Thien X Nguyen</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Thien and I am a computer science student at the University of Utah. I am currently completing my undergraduate degree, and I am particularly interested in front-end technologies. However, I have also been exploring full-stack development and AI/machine learning, as I believe these skills will be valuable in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my degree program, I have taken a number of relevant courses including Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithms and Data Structures, Software Practice I and II, Discrete Structures, Engineering Probability Statistics, and Computer Organization. I have also completed coursework in Calculus (1,2,3) and have self-studied topics outside of school such as serverless functions, APIs, and front-end frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my goals as a student is to continuously learn new skills and expand my knowledge. I am always looking for opportunities to build projects and apply what I have learned in a practical setting.
      </p>
