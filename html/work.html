          <p>(August 2021 – May 2022)</p>
          <p>As the leader of a 15-member student team, I orchestrated the successful planning, preparation, and coordination of the Asian American High School Conference on behalf of the Asian American Student Association and the University of Utah. Through collaboration with various departments on campus, local communities, venues, facilitators, speakers, performers, and volunteers, I ensured the event's seamless execution. We hosted about <b>100</b> students and <b>10</b> school advisors from high schools across Utah, offering them a wide range of engaging activities and workshops. As the accountable party for the event's success, I am proud to have delivered a meaningful experience for all involved.
          I was awarded a <b>$1000</b> Utah Asian Charitable Foundation Scholarship by the Utah Asian Chamber of Commerce a few months after the event.</p>

          <p>(June 2022 – August 2022)</p>
          <p>My expertise in <b>Microsoft's Azure Functions</b> was honed through building and studying multiple <b>HTTP Triggers</b> with JavaScript.
             I am well-versed in the workings of <b>REST APIs</b>, utilizing tools like <b>Postman</b> to test <b>API endpoints</b> and HTTP Triggers. 
             My projects have included integrations with services such as <b>Twilio</b>, <b>Microsoft Cognitive Services</b>, and <b>Giphy</b>. 
             I have also implemented <b>Blob storage</b> and <b>NoSQL databases</b> to manage data received from serverless functions. 
             In addition, I possess experience in designing, building, and testing front-end web applications using 
             <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and the <b>React</b> framework to interact seamlessly with serverless functions.

          <p>(December 2022 – Janurary 2023)</p>
          
          <p>My recent project involved building a React web application that calculates roommates rent based on individual monthly salaries. 
            In the process, I gained exposure to Typescript and end-to-end testing, as well as implementing best software development practices and 
            receiving valuable feedback from peers. This project was developed using a suite of powerful tools, 
            including <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Cypress</b>, <b>git</b>, <b>GitHub</b>, and <b>Visual Studio Code</b>. </p>
